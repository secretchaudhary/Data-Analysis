    "# Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "The Most Affected states were Texas and Louisiana and hence the company should focus on these states firstly to send people to. However, the property cost to the counties in Texas was relatively muh higher than that to the Louisiana and can be seen that the property cost of Calcasieu of Louisiana was lower than Montgomery of Texas, which means the company should be prioritising Texas over. We may also note that there may be other counties in Texas too which had higher damage than Calcasieu of Louisiana which the company should look into too. \n",
    "It is also clearly visible from the plots that the events did most damage at the coastal regions and the most affected areas are not much far from each other."
